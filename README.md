Teron Gorefiend Construct Simulator Game

Teron is more-or-less a recreation of the old ferox construct simulator flash game for practicing the construct phase of the Teron Gorefiend fight in Black Temple, World of Warcraft.

The code is freshly baked, and heavily relies on the Phaser game engine. Many of the game's images and sounds remain property of Blizzard Entertainment.
